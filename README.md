	* Reduce the status output of "Dodo Helper".
	* Added keyboard control to "Dodo Helper". This allow you to control your character using your keyboard if needed.
      * WASD = Left stick control (8 directional movement)

      * R = "-" button (Minus button)
	  * Y = "+" button (Plus button)
	  * Q = ZL button
	  * O = ZR button
	  * However, do note that Sys-botbase cannot handle too many commands at once. So when the regen is running (The green bar is filling up) or item/villager inject is in process, the keyboard control will be wonky. Please wait patiently for other process to finish first before using the keyboard control.
	* Also to prevent triggering anti-virus software detecting keylogging behavior. Keyboard control only works when the "Dodo Helper"(Dutch Sailors) window is in focus.
	  * Which mean if you want to use the keyboard control, you must first use your mouse to click the form so that it is in focus.
